SwitchTimeOpt.jl - Switching Time Optimization in Julia
=======================================================

**SwitchTimeOpt.jl** is a `Julia <https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/>`_ package to easily define and efficiently solve switching time optimization (STO) problems for linear and nonlinear systems. SwitchTimeOpt.jl supports a wide variety of nonlinear solvers through `MathProgBase.jl <https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathProgBase.jl/>`_ interface such as `Ipopt <https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Ipopt.jl/>`_, `KNITRO <https://github.com/JuliaOpt/KNITRO.jl/>`_, `NLopt <https://github.com/JuliaOpt/NLopt.jl/>`_.
